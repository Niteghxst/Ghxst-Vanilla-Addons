mod_description=Ghxst Vanilla Addons, aka GVA, strifes to add new items, gear, and mobs to the game that I felt like were missing in vanilla.\

  \n- Copper Toolset: Sword & Tools made from copper, stronger than iron but also heavier.\
  \n- Amethyst Toolset: Made with the new "Amethyst Alloy", it is stronger than diamond and serves as an inbetween set from diamond to netherite.
